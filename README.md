Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The Tic-Tac-Toe game application is a simple project developed using GUI (Graphical User Interface) in Java. It is very easy to understand and play, players generally prefer this kind of game when they’re bored and want something to play which is quick and easy.

Abstract: The game starts with two players as active members, having a one-print board on the screen which displays 9 boxes (i.e., 3×3). The first person who starts the game has to enter either X or O for any one box, followed by the other player entering the other X or O (opposite to what the first player has entered). this continues unless any one of them gets a line cut either diagonally or straight. And the person who founds the line is the winner of the game.

Technologies Used: Java, Java Swing, Java GUI (Graphical User Interface), and JFrame.add this matter also
